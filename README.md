# MarinaDB
A simple, modern C++20 database engine for learning and experimentation. Implements basic table, schema, record management, file persistence, and (in future) indexing. Designed for cross-platform use (Windows/Linux). Inspired by classic database engine literature, but built with modern C++ idioms (RAII, smart pointers, STL).
